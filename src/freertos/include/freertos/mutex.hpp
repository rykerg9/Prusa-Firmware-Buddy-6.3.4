/**
 * @file freertos_mutex.hpp
 * @brief we lack mutex support due undefined _GLIBCXX_HAS_GTHREADS, so there is mutex using FreeRTOS api
 *
 * The mutex class is a synchronization primitive that can be used to protect
 * shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads.
 *
 * mutex offers exclusive, non-recursive ownership semantics:
 *
 * A calling thread owns a mutex from the time that it successfully calls either lock or try_lock until it calls unlock.
 * When a thread owns a mutex, all other threads will block (for calls to lock) or receive a false return value (for try_lock)
 * if they attempt to claim ownership of the mutex.
 * A calling thread must not own the mutex prior to calling lock or try_lock.
 * The behavior of a program is undefined if a mutex is destroyed while still owned by any threads, or a thread terminates while owning a mutex.
 * The mutex class satisfies all requirements of Mutex and StandardLayoutType.
 *
 * mutex is neither copyable nor movable.
